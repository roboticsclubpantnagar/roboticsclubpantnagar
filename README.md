# Robotics Club Pantnagar — College of Technology

*Innovate. Build. Learn.*

Welcome to Robotics Club Pantnagar at the College of Technology, G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology — a student-driven community where curiosity meets engineering. We design, build, and program robots, run workshops, compete in national events, and mentor beginners so everyone can take part in hands-on robotics.

This repository hosts the official website for Robotics Club Pantnagar.

## About Us

Robotics Club Pantnagar is a vibrant student organization focused on robotics, automation, and embedded systems. We bring together students from diverse disciplines to collaborate on projects, host skill-building sessions, and represent our college at competitions.

- **Location:** College of Technology, G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology
- **Who can join:** Membership is open only to students of the College of Technology who join during their **2nd year**. You may only become a member while you are in your 2nd year and only through the official induction process; attending induction and passing the membership interview are **mandatory**.
Students who did not join during their 2nd year are not eligible to become new members later.
- **Meeting cadence:** Weekly working sessions and monthly talks/workshops

## Our Mission

To empower students with practical engineering skills by building real robots, fostering teamwork, and encouraging hands-on learning through projects, workshops, and competitions.

---

## What We Do

- Project teams (autonomous rovers, line-followers, robotic arms)
- Hands-on workshops (microcontrollers, ROS basics, sensors, motor control)
- Hack nights & build sessions
- Technical talks by faculty and industry guests
- Participation in national robotics competitions and exhibitions
- Mentorship for beginners and inter-college collaboration

## Recent & Ongoing Projects

- Autonomous Delivery Rover — an indoor navigation platform for package delivery using LiDAR and odometry.
- Line-Follower Racing Bot — a fast, compact bot optimized for precision and speed.
- Robotic Arm for Pick & Place — 4-DOF arm with inverse kinematics and gripper control.
- Smart Agriculture Bot (prototype) — a proof-of-concept robot for monitoring crop fields.

Want to add a project? Open an issue or start a new project board in the repo and we'll help you bootstrap it.

## How To Join


1. You may join the club only during your 2nd year at the College of Technology.
2. Induction sessions are held each year specifically for 2nd-year cohorts — attending and completing the induction is **mandatory** to be eligible for membership.
3. Following induction, candidates must pass a short membership **interview**; passing the interview is required to become a registered member.
4. Students who missed the induction window in their 2nd year are not eligible to join later as new members.
5. Keep an eye on official announcements for induction dates; we update the `induction/` and `events/` sections with schedules and signup links.
6. After successfully completing induction and the interview, introduce yourself on our Discord/Telegram (link below) or send an email, then pick a project or join a workshop.

Pro tip: Bring a laptop and some enthusiasm. We’ll help with parts and tools during build sessions.

## Events & Competitions

We participate in regional and national competitions. We also host internal hackathons and demo days where members present progress and prototypes.

If you want the latest event schedule, check our `events/` directory (coming soon) or follow our social updates.

## Get Involved — Contribution Guide

Club members contribute in many ways: code, hardware designs, documentation, tutorials, and event organization.

- **New members:** Only students who join during their 2nd year and who have completed induction and passed the membership interview may register as new members. Students who did not join during their 2nd year are not eligible to register as new members.
Start by reading `CONTRIBUTING.md` (if present) and attending the induction and onboarding session.
- **Website contributors:** Members can fork this repository, open a branch named `feature/<your-name>-<short-desc>`, and create a pull request to contribute updates, features, and content to the club website.
- **Hardware:** Note your bill of materials (BOM) and attach diagrams or photos for reproducibility.

Questions? Reach out to a club coordinator and we'll point you to a mentor.
